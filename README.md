<h2 align="center">Overview</h2>

**TicTacToe with C++** is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. This program is built in C++ and offers two modes of gameplay:

1. **Single Player Mode**: Play against a smart bot that uses strategic moves to increase the game's difficulty.
2. **Two Player Mode**: Compete against another human player in a head-to-head match.


<br>



<h2 align="center">Features</h2>

- **Single Player Mode**: 
  - Challenge yourself against a bot that employs smart tactics.
  - The bot is designed to provide a challenging experience by making optimal moves to block the player and aim for victory.
  
- **Two Player Mode**: 
  - Enjoy a traditional Tic Tac Toe game with a friend.
  - Take turns on the same computer to see who is the Tic Tac Toe master.

<h2 align="center">How to Play</h2>

1. **Choose Game Mode**: 
   - The program starts by prompting the user to choose between Single Player (with bot) or Two Player mode.

2. **Single Player Mode**:
   - Player 1 uses 'X' and Player 2 uses 'O' by default.
   - The player will take turns against the bot. The bot is designed to make strategic moves to increase the game's difficulty.
   
3. **Two Player Mode**:
   - Two players will take turns to make their moves.
   - Player 1 uses 'X' and Player 2 uses 'O' by default.

4. **Game Rules**:
   - The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
   - Players take turns to place their symbol (X or O) on the grid.
   - The first player to align three of their symbols vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.
   - If all 9 squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
